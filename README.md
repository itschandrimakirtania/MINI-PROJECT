Code Implementation for OODP Mini Project 


The Library Management System Project in C++ in a very easy and understandable way. The Library Management System can be coded using many programming languages, But in this project, we are going to use C++ language.As the name suggest the Library Management System is a software which handles the entire data of library. It makes the work of librarian very easy instead of writing data in a notebook. In past the librarians were using notebooks to write the data of books along with students name who borrowed that book. So it was very difficult to keep track on each and every book. When the librarian want’s to search for a particular book then that task was very time consuming. So with the help of the project we can make this task easy and time consuming.

Installation to use this programm, we will need a C++ Compiler such as Dev C++ etc.

In this program:

•	We have created separate logins for students and the librarian, in which the librarian is password protected.

•	In this project, the librarian can add, update, delete and create books and can also assign the books to the students.

•	The students can also view the list of the books available in the entire library database.

•	The entire rights are given to the librarian to adding books, issuing books, and modify the book

•	This project uses file handling to store the data of books in a project.

•	A Librarian can also be able to change the password.

•	Reissuing and returning the books are the main features of this project.

•	The student can also be able to see which student has already borrowed the book.
